### Project Specs
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Batch-10-specs-d18972b6307b405380a294896f2b0899)

### Instructions
- Please create an issue first and then attach that issue to the PR, so that everyone knows what’s the need of the PR. Attaching issues to the PR using Github keywords will close the issues once the PR is merged. More info [here]((https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)).

- Please follow a common git commit style guide. Somewhat similar to [this guide](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

- All PRs should be [Rebase And Merged](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)

### Some of the points to keep in mind
- Everything should be visible at the end of the day (Golden rule).
- Architecture - create an architecture of the program before starting it, lay down all the entities. Define CRUD operations for these entities, create components around these entities.
- GitHub - create guidelines for commit messages. Create a separate environment for staging and production. Always rebase your branch. Every pull request should solve a single issue. The issue must be created before any pull request and should be closed after the issue is fixed. All discussions should be done on issues.
- Slack - Everyday standups, weekly loom videos, no private messages conversation, always be in public so that anyone can improve or put his points into the arguments.
- Testing - Follow TDD as much as possible. There is no need for tests for presentational components, tests are only required for container components.
- Latest and stable - like Babel, import/ export, class variables.
- Documentation (on README)
- Abstraction- things which are common throughout the app should be abstracted like buttons, forms, inputs
- Gifs/ video for frontend PRs.
- Review each others PR.
- Don’t commit in someone else PR
